Proof of concept code
Data values from a table get translated using values in table Translation

Idea is to have a table with lookup values - (i.e. Number) sorted by some specific order.
When user code queries  data from Number table data values get retrived from translation if exists. If translation does not
exists - original value returned from Number table.

it is just quick code - have nothing to do -)))
